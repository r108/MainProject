	<b>Access Control</b>
	
	There are two access levels:
	1) Employee
	2) Manager

	<b>Employee access</b>
	Allows only the most rudimentary of tasks to be carried out. For example, you may view the current customer list, 
	the current supplier list, or the stock list. However, you are not permitted to edit any details.

	<b>Manager access</b>
	This level allows access to all parts of the program. Entries may be added, edited, or even removed. So, when ordering in 
	new stock for the business, you may keep track of this by updating the list on this application. 
	Similarly, when a new supplier begins deliveries to the company, their details may be added to the supplier
	database.
	
	If you are a manager, and are currently logged in with an employee username, please log out by selecting the 
	"Logout" command in the "User" drop-down menu bar, and then log in again using your correct details.
